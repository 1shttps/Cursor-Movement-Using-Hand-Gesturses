# Cursor-Movement-Using-Hand-Gesturses
This Python script uses the Mediapipe library to capture hand gestures via webcam. Recognized gestures, such as fist, V-gesture, and pinch, control actions like mouse clicks, scrolling, and system settings (brightness and volume). The code is modular with classes for gesture recognition, hand tracking, and ensuring clarity and organization.
